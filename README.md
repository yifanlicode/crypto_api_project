## 1. Gathering and Storing Data

### 1.1 Datasets

### 1.3 AR Models

```bash
rails generate model User username:string email:string password_digest:string
rails generate model Cryptocurrency uuid:string symbol:string name:string color:string icon_url:string market_cap:string price:string listed_at:integer tier:integer change:string rank:integer sparkline:text low_volume:boolean coinranking_url:string 24h_volume:string
rails generate model Watchlist user:references name:string
rails generate model CryptocurrenciesWatchlists cryptocurrency:references watchlist:references
```

### 1.4 Model Associations and Validations

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :watchlists
  has_many :cryptocurrencies, through: :watchlists

  validates :username, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true
  validates :password_digest, presence: true
end

class Cryptocurrency < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :cryptocurrencies_watchlists
  has_many :watchlists, through: :cryptocurrencies_watchlists

  validates :uuid, presence: true
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :price, presence: true
  end

class Watchlist < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :cryptocurrencies_watchlists
  has_many :cryptocurrencies, through: :cryptocurrencies_watchlists

  validates :user_id, presence: true
  validates :name, presence: true
end

class CryptocurrenciesWatchlist < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :cryptocurrency
  belongs_to :watchlist

  validates :cryptocurrency_id, presence: true
  validates :watchlist_id, presence: true
end
```

这是做 views

🕯️ **2.1** **- About Page -** Your web application has an about page that includes the details about your data sources from 1.1 and optionally your ERD from 1.2.
做一个简单的页面来介绍，比如 navbar ，做一个 about 页面，一些功能页
💡 **2.2 - Menu -** There is a menu present on all pages that includes links to two or more locations. (For example, a menu with a link to your homepage and your about page.)

## 3 - Data Navigation

**🌟** 🕯️ **3.1** - **Collection Navigation** - There exists a way for the user to navigate through the data you’ve collected at a high level. (For example, table or list of the entire data collection.)

对数据可以进行 筛选 排列

💡 **3.2** **- Member Pages -** There exists a page (show?) for each of the individual entries of the data you have collected to display all the attributes of the collected data point.

💡 **3.3** **- Multi-model Data on Member Pages -**  On the individual entry pages (3.2) data pulled from associated models is also present.
这个没理解

**🔥 3.4** **- Hierarchical Collection Navigation -** Data can be navigated by category or hierarchically based on a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship. (This means being able to navigate via a link back and forth between the “show” pages of your associations. For example, category “show” pages that link to the  “show” page of all items in that category, with the “show” pages of each item linking back to the “show” page of the item’s category.)
分类

💡 **3.5 - Pagination -** Large collections of data are presented using pagination. (You can use the [kaminari gem](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) or a javascript library to implement this feature.)

**🔥 3.6** **- Mapping -** Location data is presented on a map (either one map for the entire collection or a separate map for each data point). This feature will only be possible for students who have imported datasets that includes addresses or GPS coordinates. In other words, you can’t just add a random map to your project to get these marks. The map can be provided using the [Google Static Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/) or [Google Maps Javascript](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/plotting-points-on-a-map-from-scratch). (Google Maps API now requires a credit card to activate your API key. For low usage projects the API is still free. An alternative would be [the Map Box Static Map API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static).)

## 4 - Searching and Filtering

**🌟** 🕯️ **4.1** **- Simple Search -** Users can use a simple form to perform a text search through the available data.
用户可以搜索，这很重要

💡 **4.2** **- Hierarchical Search -** A user’s search can be restricted to a specific category (or other one-to-many / many-to-many relationship) using a dropdown within the search form.

### 5 - Markup and Design

**🌟** 🕯️ **5.1** **- Valid HTML -** All HTML generated by your app validates as HTML5 with no errors.
HTML 设计，送分

🕯️ **5.2 - ERB Conditional -** At least one of your ERB views includes a conditional (if or unless). _Don’t use the Demo example, use your own!_

💡 **5.3** **- Bootstrap Grid -** You built your markup and styling around the Bootstrap or Bulma CSS frameworks (or a similar framework). **_At a minimum_** your layout should be built around your framework’s **_grid system_**.
这个也是送分的。

### 6 - Source Control

**🌟** 🕯️ **6.1** **- GIT and GitHub -** You have configured git and github to keep your source under control with the ability to push from master to origin.
送分的

🕯️ **6.2** **- 20 GIT Commits -** You’ve used git to keep your source under control _with a minimum of 20 commits._ Commits must be accompanied by reasonable commit messages.
送分的
