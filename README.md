## How to build the application

### 1. Gathering and Storing Data

#### 1.1 Datasets

- [CoinRanking API](https://api.coinranking.com/v2/coins).It is a free API that provides cryptocurrency data.
- [Faker Gem](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker). It is used to generate fake users.

#### 1.3 AR Models

Create the models and migrations for the tables above.

```bash

rails generate model Cryptocurrency uuid:string symbol:string name:string color:string icon_url:string market_cap:string price:string listed_at:integer tier:integer change:string rank:integer sparkline:text low_volume:boolean coinranking_url:string 24h_volume:string

rails generate model Watchlist user:references name:string

rails generate model CryptocurrenciesWatchlists cryptocurrency:references watchlist:references
```

Use Devise to generate the User model.

```bash
rails generate devise:install
rails generate devise User
rails generate devise:views
```

Run the migrations.

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

#### 1.4 Model Associations and Validations

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord

 has_many :watchlists
 has_many :cryptocurrencies, through: :watchlists

devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
end


class Cryptocurrency < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :cryptocurrencies_watchlists
  has_many :watchlists, through: :cryptocurrencies_watchlists

  validates :name, presence: true
  end

class Watchlist < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :cryptocurrencies_watchlists
  has_many :cryptocurrencies, through: :cryptocurrencies_watchlists

  validates :user_id, presence: true
  validates :name, presence: true
end

class CryptocurrenciesWatchlist < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :cryptocurrency
  belongs_to :watchlist

  validates :cryptocurrency_id, presence: true
  validates :watchlist_id, presence: true
end
```

#### 1.5 Seed Script

```bash
rails db:seed
```

### 2. Web Site Navigation -- Done

app/controllers/home_controller.rb
app/views/page/about.html.erb
app/views/home/\_footer.html.erb
app/views/home/\_header.html.erb

config/routes.rb

```ruby
  get 'home/about', to: 'home#about'
  root 'home#index'
```

### 3 - Data Navigation

#### 3.1 List all the cryptocurrencies in a table

`app/views/cryptocurrencies/index`

path:
`cryptocurrencies_path `

#### 3.2 Display cryptocurrecy infomation by :id

`app/views/cryptocurrencies/_cryptocurrency.html.erb`
`app/views/cryptocurrencies/show.html.erb`

#### 3.3 Multi-model Data on Member Pages

On one user's watchlist page, show all followed coins.

**🔥 3.4** **- Hierarchical Collection Navigation -** Data can be navigated by category or hierarchically based on a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship. (This means being able to navigate via a link back and forth between the “show” pages of your associations. For example, category “show” pages that link to the  “show” page of all items in that category, with the “show” pages of each item linking back to the “show” page of the item’s category.)

💡 **3.5 - Pagination -** Large collections of data are presented using pagination. (You can use the [kaminari gem](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) or a javascript library to implement this feature.)

**🔥 3.6** **- Mapping -** Location data is presented on a map (either one map for the entire collection or a separate map for each data point). This feature will only be possible for students who have imported datasets that includes addresses or GPS coordinates. In other words, you can’t just add a random map to your project to get these marks. The map can be provided using the [Google Static Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/) or [Google Maps Javascript](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/plotting-points-on-a-map-from-scratch). (Google Maps API now requires a credit card to activate your API key. For low usage projects the API is still free. An alternative would be [the Map Box Static Map API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static).)

## 4 - Searching and Filtering

**🌟** 🕯️ **4.1** **- Simple Search -** Users can use a simple form to perform a text search through the available data.
用户可以搜索，这很重要

💡 **4.2** **- Hierarchical Search -** A user’s search can be restricted to a specific category (or other one-to-many / many-to-many relationship) using a dropdown within the search form.

### 5 - Markup and Design

**🌟** 🕯️ **5.1** **- Valid HTML -** All HTML generated by your app validates as HTML5 with no errors.
HTML 设计，送分

🕯️ **5.2 - ERB Conditional -** At least one of your ERB views includes a conditional (if or unless). _Don’t use the Demo example, use your own!_

💡 **5.3** **- Bootstrap Grid -** You built your markup and styling around the Bootstrap or Bulma CSS frameworks (or a similar framework). **_At a minimum_** your layout should be built around your framework’s **_grid system_**.
这个也是送分的。

### 6 - Source Control

**🌟** 🕯️ **6.1** **- GIT and GitHub -** You have configured git and github to keep your source under control with the ability to push from master to origin.
送分的

🕯️ **6.2** **- 20 GIT Commits -** You’ve used git to keep your source under control _with a minimum of 20 commits._ Commits must be accompanied by reasonable commit messages.
